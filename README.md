This is "next" version of my [Digital Clock 4](https://github.com/Kolcha/DigitalClock4). It has completely new written from scratch skin engine (but old skins are supported) which adds many new features and possibilities giving even more flexibility in customization.

Some key features:

* full compatibility with old skin format
* good font rendering (minimal difference with text editors)
* good Unicode support (including emoji)
* font-like rendering for image-based skins due to [skin format extension](https://github.com/Kolcha/DigitalClock5/wiki/Extended-legacy-skin-format)
* gradient filling for numbers and background
* [multiple time zones](https://github.com/Kolcha/DigitalClock5/wiki/Multiple-timezones) (or just multiple windows) support
* tray icon displays local time (implemented just-for-fun)

A lot of useful information about app usage and possible customization options can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Kolcha/DigitalClock5/wiki). Also some useful links and contact information can be found in the app's About dialog.

Downloads are published on SourceForge.
